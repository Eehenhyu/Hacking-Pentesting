Unlike web application hacking, you have to be physically near the place with the systems you're trying to gain access to, which makes wireless hacking not as universal but still a good option. Wireless hacking can also be done via Rougue APs and Evil Twin attacks.\n",

    "All that's needed for these attacks is an AP(access point, which is a router) and a device connecting to it, as well as a NIC(network interface card) that supports \"monitor mode.\" Many attacks work better when capturing a \"handshake.\" This process involes: scan the area -> select the router -> find and select a device connected to that router -> deauthenticate that device -> capture the handshake when device attempts to reauthenticate.\n",

    "Having a MAC changer is also helpful since some APs are whitelisted for only specific MAC addresses.\n",

    "*KEEP IN MIND:* Your position can be triangulated when doing this within 4 sqaure meters if the defender has the technical know-how and equiptment for it, this is unlikely in majority of attacks and doesn't work well if everyone around you has laptops too."

    " - Scan target in one terminal:`airodump-ng --channel # --bssid #:#:#:#:#:# --write FileName interface_name`\n",
    " - Use fake authentication in a different terminal: `aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a #:#:#:#:#:# -h #:#:#:#:#:# interface_name` (0 is the number of packets sent,first #:# is target MAC, second is our MAC)\n",

    "In WPA each packet is encrypted with a unique temporary key so the number of data packets that we collect is irrelevant. WPA and WPA2 are similar the only difference is that WPA2 uses an algorithm called CCMP. Some APs have WPA/WPA2 with WPS enabled. WPS is an 8 digit long pin used to authenticate to the AP, so there is a relatively small number of pin combinations and using brute force we can guess the pin in less than 10 hours.\n",
    "We'll use reaver to recover the WPA/WPA key from the pin.\n",
    "\n",
    "*NOTE:* This is a flaw in WPS, not in WPA/WPA2,however it allows us to crack any WPA/WPA2 AP without using a\n",
    "wordlist and without any clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**WPS PIN Enabled**\n",
    " - We scan for WPS enabled APs with wash: `wash -i interface_name`\n",
    " - Bruteforce the WPS pin and get key: `reaver -i interface_name -b #:#:#:#:#:# -c #`(target AP MAC and channel, -vv is for verbose output so we can see what's going on)\n",
    " - *KEEP IN MIND:* Most WPS pins will lock after a certain number of failed attempts that are in a short time period, so you can add a delay/lock delay flag in reaver to help with this. Also, if the AP gets locked you can just deauthenticate all clients until the owner thinks something went wrong and just resets the AP, but if they have to constantly reset it then further investigations may be called so it isn't a good idea to keep locking it, and since reaver supports a pause and resume feature, if it really does take searching the whole key space, do it over time, no need to rush this.\n",
    " - If getting the message \"Failed to associate...\" then run a fake authentication(make sure to set the packets sent to 100 or so since we want this to stay associated while reaver is working) and run reaver again but use the flag to not associate this time since we've now done this manually\n",
    " - If still stuck then run reaver again but with the -vvv options at the very end of the command and use --help to see if any info is there after looking at the output, may need to use --no-knacks flag\n",
    " - If no human intervention is wanted then we can use MDK3 to DDoS the router and in some routers if you use this attack then it automatically resets and unlocks WPS, this is pretty good with reaver since if you get locked out at 50% then you can pause, run this attack, then continue if needed, to run the attack use: `mdk3 interface_name a -a #:#:#:#:#:# -m` (targets MAC)\n",
    " - Depending on the router it may take 5000 clients or 50,000, don't worry about the \"seems to be INVULNERABLE\" message, after around 10,000 clients `<ctrl> + c` and run wash again to check if WPS is still locked, if it passes 50,000 clients and is still locked then the target AP probably is invulnerable to this so just move on\n",

    "Bit squatting is when one of the bits of the domain name is randomly flipped due to an error no one can control/predict within the system trying to access that domain name. The domain name of http://www.domain-name.ext can be represented in bytes(8 bit segments) of 0 and 1's, like 01001011 10110101 etc. So when the system makes a mistake one of those 0's or 1's will flip to whichever number it isn't. We can take advantage of this by registering a domain which is 1 bit different from the domain we're attacking, there's only around a 0.000001% chance that some user will have their bits flip in the exact way we need but if there's 1 billion requests then 1 thousand of those requests will have the exact bit flip we need(majority of big sites have purchased all the domain names with a bit mask off by 1).\n",
