    "Wireless is one of the main entry points for gaining access to systems and can be used for a host of other attacks once the connection is the wireless network is established. Unlike web application hacking, you have to be physically near the place with the systems you're trying to gain access to, which makes wireless hacking not as universal but still a good option.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many types of wireless that can hacked into and many tools available. We'll use the most popular tools and cover many different types of wireless in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "All that's needed for these attacks is an AP(access point, which is a router) and a device connecting to it, as well as a NIC(network interface card) that supports \"monitor mode.\" Many attacks work better when capturing a \"handshake.\" This process involes: scan the area -> select the router -> find and select a device connected to that router -> deauthenticate that device -> capture the handshake when device attempts to reauthenticate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a MAC changer is also helpful since some APs are whitelisted for only specific MAC addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "*KEEP IN MIND:* Your position can be triangulated when doing this within 4 sqaure meters if the defender has the technical know-how and equiptment for it, this is unlikely in majority of attacks and doesn't work well if everyone around you has laptops too."
