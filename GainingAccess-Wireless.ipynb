    "Wireless is one of the main entry points for gaining access to systems and can be used for a host of other attacks once the connection is the wireless network is established. Unlike web application hacking, you have to be physically near the place with the systems you're trying to gain access to, which makes wireless hacking not as universal but still a good option.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many types of wireless that can hacked into and many tools available. We'll use the most popular tools and cover many different types of wireless in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "All that's needed for these attacks is an AP(access point, which is a router) and a device connecting to it, as well as a NIC(network interface card) that supports \"monitor mode.\" Many attacks work better when capturing a \"handshake.\" This process involes: scan the area -> select the router -> find and select a device connected to that router -> deauthenticate that device -> capture the handshake when device attempts to reauthenticate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a MAC changer is also helpful since some APs are whitelisted for only specific MAC addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "*KEEP IN MIND:* Your position can be triangulated when doing this within 4 sqaure meters if the defender has the technical know-how and equiptment for it, this is unlikely in majority of attacks and doesn't work well if everyone around you has laptops too."

    "It's best to keep all the password lists in the same directory. By default Kali comes with a few different wordlists but just in case they're needed then downloading them is simply a matter of google searching for passworld lists and saving them(some files may need to be decompressed, also installing an application like xsensor can be helpful to monitor temperature of CPUs/GPUs and htop to monitor usage of these while cracking). \n",
    "\n",
    "*KEEP IN MIND:* These lists can be used for any area that requires password/login information, not just wireless! Also, CPUs tend to stop functioning near/after 105 degrees celcius so stopping the process then letting it cool and resuming would be the best option if no more cooling is available. Also CPU usage can be overclocked if needed to speed this process up(can check CPU speed in /proc/cpuinfo)! \n",

    " - If needed take a look at the charset: `cat charset.lst`\n",

    " - The above wordlist isn't feasible to create since it would take over 8000 PB of space, this can be seen by running the program then immediately stopping it with: `<ctrl> + c`\n",
    " - To see further specifications like structure of the password where letters/numbers would go, if patterns repeat or not, etc., use: `man crunch`\n",
    " - Here's an example: `crunch 16 16 -d 1@ -t @@@@%%%%@@@@%%50 -f charset.lst mixalpha-numeric` (this says to use a password of length 16 that as the structure of 4 lowercase letters then 4 numbers then 4 lowercase letters and 2 numbers followed by 50, and once one letter is used, dont use it again)\n",
    " - To use this with aircrack: `crunch 16 16 -d 1@ -t @@@@%%%%@@@@%%50 -f charset.lst mixalpha-numeric | aircrack-ng -w - -b #:#:#:#:#:# CaptureFileName-01.cap` (#:#... is the MAC address, -f specifies the file to use and its path if needed, -w specifies a dictionary file to use but since we're using crunch we follow it up with another - so it takes the output of crunch and uses that instead, -b is just the bssid of the AP)\n",
