    "These attacks can be the same thing or have their own areas such as: Sneaking on the site where the systems are and using a variety of lockpick/bypass methods to get tot he target system, using USB keyloggers/rubber ducky's to deploy malware, using drones to scan the site containing the target systems and the drone could have a rapsberry pi attached to scan the WiFi it's near, etc. There a lot of ways to get creative with physical attacks. We'll go over some of them here."

    "The USB will act as a keyboard and not a storage device, so that when it's inserted into a system it will, within a couple seconds, begin to execute a predefined set of functions. This can be done with a reprogrammed USB device or a USB specifically made for this like a Rubber Ducky.\n",

    "For this we'll use: an Arduino Tinsy, any standard USB, Arduino IDE, Teensyduino. It's also a good idea to have a copy of Windows, which can be just be a virtual image that you can get for free from microsoft, just google \"windows 10 iso\" and it should be one of the first links(it'll only be a trial though), to test out the exploit and it will be needed for writing the PowerShell scripts.\n",

    "**SetUp for KeyLogger**\n",
    " - Download the Windows 10 VM and run it.\n",
    " - Install CodeBlocks IDE in the Windows 10 VM(the mingw-setup.exe one from the Sourceforge link).\n",
    " - Create a project and make sure to use C++.\n",
    " - Download the keylogger from: https://github.com/Creator69/Keylogger-\n",
    " - Extract the files, open the new project and right-click the project file name.\n",
    " - Add files then add all the header files.\n",
    " - Right click sources and remove it.\n",
    " - Right click project file name and add main file.\n",
    " - Go into the \"SendMail\" file and edit the \"TO\", \"FROM\", and \"PASS\" options at the top with who the email is being sent to(yourself), which account the email is being sent from(yourself), and the password of the email its being sent from(yours).\n",
    " - We're sending it to ourselves because this script is running the keylogger form someone else's system.\n",
    " - Can change the timer for sending emails in the \"KeybHook\" file, in the middle top you'll see a \"Timer Mailtimer ...\" with \"2000 * 60\" for time, which is 2 minutes, this can be changed to anything.\n",
    " - Go to Setting -> Compiler -> Check \"C++11 ISO\" -> Right-click -> New flag\n",
    " - Name can be anything, Compiler flag:`-mwindows`, Linker flag:`-mwindows` , click OK and check the box for it and click OK again \n",
    " - Run it to make sure there's no problems, open task manager and end the task of \"KeyLogger\" in background processes\n",

The script checks if internet is there or not, if it is then it fetches the keylogger, if not it'll sleep until it is and it'll even run at boot time. After running and successfully installing the keylogger, the script will remove itself.\n",
