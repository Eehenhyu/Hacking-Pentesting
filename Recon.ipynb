    "WARNING: Keep in mind you are responsible for all traffic going through! \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to do this. We'll go over some of them. Keep in mind it's a good idea to make sure your IP is actually changing and not leaking(), to do this just do a google/duckduckgo search for \"what is my ip\".\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: All searches can be done with Google or DuckDuckGo.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Connecting to a free proxy:\n",
    " - Search for \"list of free proxies\"\n",
    " - Generally better to use SOCKS5 proxies in Europe/US\n",
    " - Will need \"proxychains\" installed so check for it with `find` , `locate` , or `search`\n",
    " - Open up the proxychains configuration file with: `vi /etc/proxychains.conf` \n",
    " - Dynamic chain is best to use here since you'll never know when/if the chosen proxies will go down and with this options is automatically chooses the next proxy in the list\n",
    " - By default is no chains are specified then the TOR network will be used\n",
    " - To enter proxies to use, at the bottom of the file insert: `socks5 127.0.0.1 9050`\n",
    " - Now list the proxies under this in this format(socksVersion IPaddress PortNumber)\n",
    " - Now save then run the brower through the proxies with: `proxychains firefox`\n",
    " - Generally free proxies are slow and unstable so its good to have 5 or more\n",
    " - As a final step make sure to check your IP again to ensure that the proxy is being used(your IP should now be the proxies IP)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Setting up a proxy via the cloud:\n",
    "**Setting up the Server**\n",
    " - Select a service provider for the server, can be AWS/Google/DigitalOcean,etc.\n",
    " - It's a good idea to generate your own RSA key for server log-ins(will need PuTTY installed on Windows)\n",
    " - To generate the key: `ssh-keygen -t rsa` , then just press \\<enter> unless you want to change where the file containing the key is saved to\n",
    " - Go to the key: `cd /home/user_name/.ssh/` then `ls` and you should see \"id_rsa id_rsa.pub known_hosts\"\n",
    " - Output the public key and copy the entire output starting with \"ssh\": `cat id_rsa.pub` \n",
    " - Can now use this as an SSH key for the server you're configuring\n",
    " - Now try using it on the server: `ssh root@#.#.#.#` (the #'s are the IP of the server)\n",
    " - Should get a message saying host cannot be established since it doesn't match anything in the non-host file, this makes sense since everything was just deleted from this non-host file so type `yes` to continue\n",
    " - The non-host file now has the key and you are now logged into the machine\n",
    " - Confirm login with: `ifconfig` , make sure the IP address matches\n",
    " - Now we need to add a user: `adduser user_name` and password, then can just enter everything after(leave as blank)\n",
    " - Open up the SSH config file: `vi /etc/ssh/ssh_config` , under \"Authentication\" change \"PreventRootLogin\" to \"without-password\"\n",
    " - Restart SSH: `service ssh restart` , and `service sshd restart` , then `exit` , and log back in as root\n",
    " - It should now request a password when logging in as root, if not then try changing \"without-permission\" to just \"no\", once you can no longer log in using the correct password then change from \"root\" to \"user_name\" and use that password\n",
    " - After logging in get to root with: `su` , now go to: `cd /root` , then: `ls -a`, into: `cd .ssh/` and finally: `ls` \n",
    " - You should now see \"authorized_keys\", create a new directory for the user_name and copy the keys there: `mkdir /home/user_name/.ssh/` and `cp authorized_keys /home/user_name/.ssh/` , go into it: `cd /home/sheep`\n",
    " - Modify the permissions to change ownership: `chown -R user_name:user_name .ssh/` , now: `exit` and `exit`\n",
    " - Now try logging in again as \"user_name\" and no password should be needed, you now just login with keys\n",
    " - What we've done is remove the root user from direct ssh logins, so no more logging into the server as root, you can still login as a normal user and then become root, this is just an extra layer of security\n",
    " \n",
    "**Installing the Proxy Server**\n",
    " - Become root  and install the squid proxy server: `apt-get install squid3`\n",
    " - Make sure to backup the config file in case anything goes wrong: `cp /etc/squid3/squid.conf /etc/squid3/squid.conf.original`\n",
    " - Make sure it isn't write-able(so no one can change the original settings being used as a backup): `chmod -w /etc/squid3/squid.conf.original` , check it with:`ls -l /etc/squid3/squid.conf.original`(should have no w's)\n",
    " - Modify the conf file: `vi /etc/squid3/squid.conf` , many configuration changes can be made, the default port is 3128\n",
    " - Make sure the port is open by opening another terminal and using nmap: `nmap #.#.#.#`(# is the ip of the server)\n",
    " - In the server terminal :`systemctl status squid3.service` , this should be \"active(running)\" , can replace \"status\" with \"start\" or \"restart\" if needed\n",
    " - In the nmap terminal make sure no proxychains are currently setup, and if they are then delete them: `vi /etc/proxychains.conf` , after that make sure to add the server we're using since it's the proxy we want to connect to: `http #.#.#.# 3128` (add this at the bottom)\n",
    " - In the server terminal type:`iptables -L` and the \"Chain INPUT\" should contain no entries so the default policy will be the drop the packets\n",
    " - Now we modify the squid conf again, so there with vi, then search for the string we need with: `<esc>` into: `:/http_access` , then \\<enter> and keep pressing \"n\" to go to the next instance of the string until you get to \"#http_access\" and remove the \"#\" then keep going until \"http_access deny all\" and change \"deny\" to \"allow\"\n",
    " - Now start the service again: `systemctl start squid3.service`\n",
    " - Back in the nmap terminal:`proxychains4 firefox` (make sure all instances of FireFox are closes before starting this)\n",
    " - In the server terminal install wireshark: `apt-get install tshark`\n",
    " - Now view the traffic:`tshark -i eth0 -f \"tcp port 3128` (-i specifies interface, -f specifies filter)\n",
    " - Remember to check IP again in FireFox to make sure it matches the server, can also check \"DNS leak test\"!\n",
    " - If you see in the proxychains that port 80 is being DENIED or something is going on with the ports, then check the port configuration file again(squid proxy config)\n",
    "**Setup to Monitor everything through Wireshark**\n",
    " - In the server terminal install tshark and wireshark(tshark should already be installed): `apt-get install tshark wireshark`\n",
    " - View/confirm the wirehark group:`cat /etc/group` , should see a group called wireshark, this is where we need to add our regular user\n",
    " - Add the user to wireshark group: `usermod -a -G wireshark user_name` then: `newgrp wireshark`, `exit`,`exit` , should now be user_name again and should be able to run tshark\n",
    " - Check that tshark runs: `tshark -i eth0` ,should see a bunch of traffic, stop process with \\<ctrl> + c\n",
    " - We want to do this as a non-root user since wireshark has thousands of lines of code which increases its vulnerability and its safer to run as non-root user\n",
    " - Open new terminal and type:`wireshark -k -i < (ssh user_name@#.#.#.# \"tshark -F pcap -w - -f 'not tcp port 22'\")` , here the -i is the interface but that doesn't have to be just the network interface, it can also be a pipe file or live stream of information like we have here(with this command we're simply redirecting wiresharks output) , the wireshark GUI should now open up\n",
    " - Should now see packets being captured in wireshark, if not try:`ping 8.8.8.8` (Google)\n",
    " - Can check where the IP is coming from with:`whois #.#.#.#`(# is IP address)\n",
    " - On the server terminal, start the server: `su` then `systemctl start squid3.service`\n",
    " - In another terminal check the proxychains: `vi /etc/proxychains.conf` and should still have the squid proxy there only, if not then change it to be just that\n",
    " - Now run firefox through it: `proxychains4 firefox` , can now use Wireshark to check your own packets through the proxy!\n",
